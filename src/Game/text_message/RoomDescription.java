            You are seeing the show stage, it's not that impressive.
            There are little stars hanging from the roof.

            You are seeing the dining area, there are lots of party hats on three long tables.
            There are also lots of balloons, pretty cool birthday decoration.

    public static String backstage = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing the back stage. It's really scary, you can see at least 7 different heads.
            These heads all belong to the different animatronics, there is also an exoskeleton laying around.
            This is the inside of the animatronics and the reason they can move around.
            Be careful if they try putting you into a costume with one inside it.
            IT WONT END WELL!

    public static String restrooms = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing a long hallway with 2 doors to each of the restrooms, male and female.
            The whole buildings floor is designed like a chess field with black and white squares all around.
            There a different sized Pizzas hanging on the walls for decoration, nice details.

    public static String pirateCove = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing Foxxys pirate cove the curtain is able to open due to his 3 stages, don't let him get to stage 4.
            Trust me.
            DON'T LET HIM TO STAGE FOUR 4444!!!!!!

    public static String kitchen = grey+"""
            
            
            This camera is somehow disabled, you can't really see much, well you can hear the animatronics.
            The audio system of the cam works well so, you are able to recognize the sounds to 'see' the animatronics.
            Sometimes the camera footage is back for a split second must be a loose contact in the wires.
            You can't really see much of the kitchen, but the glowing animatronic eyes are noticeable.
            
            
            """+reset;
    public static String supplyCloset = grey+"""
            
            
            What do you expect it's a supply closet.
            It's just a tiny little room with the chess design all over the rooms floor and half of the wall like the rest of the building.
            
            
            """+reset;
    public static String westHall = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing a long scary hallway.
            Design is the same as the rest, chess inspired squares.
            On the wall are drawings from kids, that's cute.
            You can't really see color, because the cams are all in black & white.
            
            
            """+reset;
    public static String westHallCorner = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing the Corner of the long scary hallway.
            It's not that interesting, just a few cups on the ground laying around.
            But you can see a picture of freddy on the wall.
            Be careful, if Bonnie enters this place, he is directly staring into your soul through the camera.
            It's really scary, hope you don't see him on the cam. 
            
            
            """+reset;
    public static String eastHall = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing the east hall, it's not that different than the other hall.
            It's really dark so you can't really see much.
            There are for some reason lots of monitors on the ground, but they are placed near the wall, so they won't be in the way.
            That's to bad, would be better for you if they blocked the hall.
            Anyways the most interesting part of the hall is surely the Foxxy head sticking out the wall.
            Why the fuck would you put this creepy thing there.
            
            
            """+reset;
    public static String eastHallCorner = grey+"""
            
            
            You are seeing the corner of the east hall.
            Well who would have guessed, if the hall is dark and unspecial the corner is it as well.
            If you see Chica in this camera, don't worry, she looks fine.
            But if you see Freddy, you definitely are going to see him.
            He is almost eating the camera, he is so close to it, you are getting jump scared by him trough the camera.
            He looks so terrifying, i hope you won't see him in this cam.
